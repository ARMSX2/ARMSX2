// What ends a TileGpu render pass, what only ends an indirect run inside one, and the one bit of
// that the device gets to decide.
//
// A pass is its ATTACHMENTS. Vulkan cannot change which images a render pass renders into without
// ending it, so the colour surface, whether there is a depth attachment at all, and which depth
// surface it is are always in the key. Depth WRITE-ENABLE and depth COMPARE-ENABLE are not
// attachments -- they are two bits of VkPipelineDepthStencilStateCreateInfo, and the executor
// already rebinds a pipeline per indirect run inside a pass, on topology and on the blend key. So
// they COULD leave the key and cut the run instead. Whether they should is a hardware question with
// two measured answers, and GSDevice::TileGpuPrefersDepthUniformPasses is where it is asked:
//
//  - MERGED (the default, and what a tiler wants). The depth write-enable used to be in the pass
//    key unconditionally, and when the alpha test's plan-time fold widened from a single alpha
//    value to an interval it started deciding ~287 more Shadow of the Colossus draws a frame
//    all-fail. Those draws are ATST=GEQUAL with AFAIL=FB_ONLY -- "a failing fragment still writes
//    the frame buffer but must not touch depth" -- so each lost its depth write, and each therefore
//    opened a render pass going in and another coming out. SotC went from 80.95 passes a frame to
//    574.95 and from 10.4 ms to 35.0 ms on an M2; the F4 scene went to 1293.65 passes and 69.9 ms.
//    Not one pixel moved. Merging gives all of it back.
//  - DEPTH-UNIFORM (what Adreno wants). The same merge measured a net LOSS on an SD865 on every
//    dump tried, while the pass-count deltas matched the model to the pass -- something on that
//    architecture charges more for mixed depth state inside a pass than the pass boundaries cost.
//
// Both polarities are pinned here, because the failure mode of either is invisible in the frame and
// enormous in the frame time, and because the two grouping sites reading different answers is the
// bug class this subsystem keeps meeting.
